          When you open the SoA_Template Access file, you'll be prompted to choose between creating a new SoA or adding to an existing one.
          <br>
          <strong>Starting a new SoA will permanently delete the previous SoA that was being worked on in this database.</strong>
      </p>
      
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h2>Lets build a SoA</h2>
        <p>Regardless of whether you're starting a new SoA or continuing an existing one, you'll be directed to the input form called SoA_Input_Form. (If you accidentally close it, you can find it under that name in the MS Access Navigation bar).
          <br>
          You'll be prompted to select the Area(s), Department(s) and Sub-Department(s) and Room(s) you want to add to the SoA:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Begin by selecting the Area. It's recommended to tackle one at a time, but you can choose to work on as many as you like.</li>
            <li>Then select the Department(s), Sub-Department(s) and Room(s). All this information is generated dynamically based on your selections.</li>
            <li>When you have selected your rooms, press the "Add to SoA" button.</li>
            <li>You can go back and add rooms from other areas, departments or sub-departments at any time. When you press the "Add to SoA" button any new entires will be added to the table "SoA".</li>
            <li>You can view the rooms that have been added by pressing the "View SoA" button.</li>
            <li>If you think you've made a series of terrible mistakes and just want to start again, press the "Start a fresh SoA" button. This will delete all content in the table so you can start again.</li>
            <li>Or if you made a tiny mistake and just want to amend a room, press the "View SoA" button and just delete the row that contains the errant room.  </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h2>Time to export</h2>
        <p>Are you ready to export your beautifully curated set of rooms into a fully functional SoA in MS Excel?</p>
        <p>To do so, press the "Build the Soa" button. It may appear as if nothing is happening but in the background magic is happening.</p>
        <p>You will be greeted with a pop up box asking to confirm if you want to continue. If you do then you will be given a file prompt. Choose where you want to save the SoA and what you want to call it and it will open automatically when its ready.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="step">
      <h2>The SoA</h2>
      <p>You should be presented with the SoA you just created and the rooms that you selected previously. For a run down on how it works, press the "SoA template Export" button at the top of this page.
