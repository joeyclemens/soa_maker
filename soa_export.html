        <h2>The Layout</h2>
        <p>
         The SoA that you have just exported is based on the Rooms you selected in the MS Access form SoA_Input_Form. You will be presented with a Summary page and tabs named for the Areas that the rooms you chose have come from.
      </p>
      <p>The formulas and formatting should be applied dynamically so there shouldnt be too much to do other than any specific things you want to add in or change. </p>
      
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h2>The Summary tab</h2>
        <p>The Summary tab is where you can see a summary of the Departments and Sub Departments that you selected.  </p>
        <ul>
          <li> 
          The Target NET (m2) column is a sub total of each Sub Department from across the other tabs. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Planning allowances (%) is set to 5% on all rows. This can be changed if you have a specific allowance for a particular Sub Department and the rest of the formulas will adjust themselves accordingly.
        </li>
        
            <li>Planning allowance Total (m2) is calculated based on the information in the Target NET (m2) column.</li>
            <li>Engineering allowance (%) is set to 5% on all rows. This can be changed if you have a specific allowance for a particular Sub Department and the rest of the formulas will adjust themselves accordingly.</li>
            <li>Engineering allowance Total (m2) is calculated based on the information in the Target NET (m2) column.</li>
          
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h2>The Other Tabs</h2>
        <p>The other tabs will be formatted identically to each other and will contain the following headers:
          <br>
          AL3, AL2, AL1, Room_ID, Room_Description, Qty, Area, Total_Area, Comments<sub style="vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller;">1</sub>.
          <br>         
        </p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>AL3, AL2, AL1 represent Area, Department and Sub Department from the SoA_Input_Form. The AL3 and AL1 columns are used in creating the Summary tab.
        </li>
          <li>Room_ID is the unique identifier for each room as set in the database<sub style="vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller;">2</sub>. 
        </li>
        <li>Room_Description is the name of the room. </li>
        <li>The Qty data has been taken from the Template SoA<sub style="vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller;">3</sub>. It can be changed and all formulas will adjust themselves accordingly.</li>
        <li>Area is the total area of the room as set in the database. The information has come from the Template SoA<sub style="vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller;">3</sub>.</li>
        <li>Total Area is the total area of the room multiplied by the Qty.</li>
        <li>Comments have come from the Template SoA and are in the database<sub style="vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller;">3</sub>.</li>
       
        <p style="font-size: smaller;"><sub style="vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller;">1</sub>As this is still an early version these column headers are likely to change in the future.</p>
        <p style="font-size: smaller;"><sub style="vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller;">2</sub>This column is just for debug purposes at this stage and may be removed</p>
        <p style="font-size: smaller;"><sub style="vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller;">3</sub>This data can easily be changed in the database should any of it be consistently wrong or just in need of updating. See the reference Template SoA for further details.</p>
      </div>
  </ul>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Notable information</h2>
      <p>Columns K:L are reserved for forumlas needed to fill the Summary Tab. The Summary uses a Vlook-up that checks those columns so any changes there may break the Summary page</p>
      <p>Formatting is created for each tab as the worksheet is created. The formulas are created dynamically based on the information passed on from the SoA_Input_Form. The data should be accurate but its always wise to check the numbers as the script isnt clever enough to determine errors, let alone fix them as it goes. </p>
